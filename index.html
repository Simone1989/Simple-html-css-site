        <h2>Tea</h2>
        <p>Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub (bush) native to Asia. After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world. There are many
          different types of tea; some, like Darjeeling and Chinese greens, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour, while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral or grassy notes. Tea originated in Southwest
          China, where it was used as a medicinal drink. It was popularized as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking spread to other East Asian countries. Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to Europe during
          the 16th century. During the 17th century, drinking tea became fashionable among Britons, who started large-scale production and commercialization of the plant in India to bypass the Chinese monopoly.</p>

        <h3>Dong Ding</h3>
        <img src="images/Dong_Ding_tea.jpg" alt="Picture of ding dong tea">
        <p>One of the world's most famous teas. The word Dong means cold. Ding means top. Dong Ding is the name of a mountain in Taiwan. For a long time people climbed up the mountain to find the highest quality teas. To avoid falling down due to the wet
          surface, they walked up with bare feet. The word Dong Ding means "climbing the mountain with cold feet". Dong Ding is known to be slightly rustic than other high-growth mountain oolons. This results in a full-fledged taste, with more complex
          and fruity bouquet and undertones of chestnut. Dong Ding, also spelled Tung-ting, is an oolong tea from Taiwan. A translation of Dong Ding is "Frozen Summit" or "Icy Peak", and is the name of the mountain in Taiwan where the tea is cultivated.
          Those plants were brought to Taiwan from the Wuyi Mountains in China's Fujian Province about 150 years ago. The mountain is located in the Lugu region of Nantou County in central Taiwan, an area long used for growing tea. Dong Ding is typically
          composed of 3-4 leaves, sometimes including a bud, picked by hand or machine. Afterwards, the tea undergoes a withering process, either outside, indoors, or a combination of both. The leaves are then tossed and bruised on large bamboo baskets,
          which begins the oxidation process. Final rolling is undertaken, either by hand or by machine. A final firing sets the oxidation typically somewhere between 15%-30% oxidation, sometimes over charcoal, giving the tea a toasty, woody flavor.</p>

        <h3>Wrestling of Dragon and Tiger tea</h3>
        <img src="images/dragon-tea.jpeg" alt="Picture of Wrestling of Dragon and Tiger tea">
        <p>“Wrestling of Dragon and Tiger” is a traditional way of tea drinking in some ethnic cultures of Yunnan. It’s not 100% puerh (and sometimes black tea is used instead). It’s a mixture of liquor and puerh. This is essentially a mixture of small amount
          of liquor and black tea (Chinese black tea Pu'erh, not what Westerners call as black tea which in fact is red tea in Orient). Usually, caffeine and alcohol mixed together can be very unhealthy if both are in large doses. It is essential to only
          use large amount of one and small amount of the other, just like Irish coffee with Bailey. The alcohol can be any, but Brandy is touted as the best tasting in Wrestling of Dragon and Tiger tea. Only put in 1/2 or 1/4 of your alcohol bottle's
          lid in tea cup and the rest should be boiled tea. It is also important to put in alcohol first and tea later, not in reverse.</p>

        <h3>Garlic tea</h3>
        <img class="garlic-img" src="images/garlic.jpg" alt="Picture of Garlic tea">
        <p>Garlic is world-renowned for its place in sauces, soups and other dishes. It has also gained a great deal of attention for its potential to fight infection, reduce cholesterol and blood pressure, and otherwise protect the body when taken in moderation.
          Garlic tea is a perfect vehicle for garlic's benefits. Garlic contains antioxidants, as well as allicin, the compound behind many of garlic's health benefits. But in 2003, the scientific journal ''Phytotherapy Research'' published a literature
          review from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences that casts a potential shadow on garlic. The review notes although garlic is used to address a variety of ailments including cancer, infections and hepatic function, it also contains compounds
          that can harm the heart, liver and kidneys if ingested in large doses. Some garlic teas include other ingredients like honey and lemon. To make garlic tea, first chop the garlic to release allicin. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil, then turn off
          the heat. Add one to three cloves of garlic, depending on your preference. If desired, add lemon juice and honey to taste. Oregon State University notes that allicin is inactivated by cooking, but chopping and letting the garlic stand for at
          least 10 minutes before exposing to heat can help preserve allicin.</p>
